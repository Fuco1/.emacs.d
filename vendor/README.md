# vendor

This directory hosts packages abandoned by the authors or no longer available from package archives.  When possible I try to keep the `package.el` conventions:

* package lives inside `packagename-version` directory
* there is a `packagename-pkg.el` definition file
* there is a `packagename-autolaods.el` autoload file
* other `.el` files are at the top level of the package directory.

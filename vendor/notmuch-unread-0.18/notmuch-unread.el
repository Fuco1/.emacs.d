;;; Commentary:

;; This global minor mode alters the mode line to display the number
;; of messages with the "unread" tag in notmuch.

;;; Code:

(defvar notmuch-unread-update-timer nil
  "Timer for updating the mode line.")

(defcustom notmuch-unread-update-interval 5
  "The number of seconds to wait in between updates."
  :type 'integer
  :group 'notmuch-unread)

(defcustom notmuch-unread-search-term "tag:unread"
  "The search term to pass to notmuch count."
  :type 'string
  :group 'notmuch-unread)

(defun notmuch-unread-count ()
  "Return the number of messages that match
`notmuch-unread-search-term`."
  (string-to-number
   (replace-regexp-in-string
    "\n" ""
    (notmuch-command-to-string "count" notmuch-unread-search-term))))

(defun notmuch-unread-update-handler ()
  "Update the mode line."
  (setq notmuch-unread-mode-line-string
        (format " [âœ‰ %d]" (notmuch-unread-count)))

# files

This directory hosts extra configuration for foreign or my own packages.  Most of it is located in the `vendor.el` file, but some more elaborate packages like `org`, `dired` or `smartparens` have their own config files which are loaded from `vendor.el`.

The `vendor.el` file is organized using the excellent `use-package` macro.

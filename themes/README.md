# themes

My theme which is a modified `tango-dark`.

An interesting feature is a "common" markup framework, which is a family of `markup-*` faces which are then inherited by `org`, `outline`, `markdown`, `rst`, `textile`, `latex` and other markup languages.  This ensures that the look&feel is consistent across all the markup languages.

It also supports both 65535 and 256 color schemes.
